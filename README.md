This project was developed by a student learning the javaScript and jQuery programming languages.

Creating this game gave the developer jQuery and javaScript coding experience. 

This project is useful because it combines many javaScript and jQuery concepts in practical and entertaining 

ways. It is the developer's hope that you find this game fun to play.
